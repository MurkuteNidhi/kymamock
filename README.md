# OData Mock Server

This is a Mock Server for OData API's (e.g. from S/4HANA, ECC etc.).

This project implies to work as SAP S/4HANA Cloud Mock backend server for the Reference Applications use cases. The project is built on Cloud Application Programming ([CAP](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/)) model with mocking capabilities.

## Why to use

1. Speed up mission implementation. SAP Customer can get an overview of the scenario even without ERP/Cloud Connector configuration.
2. Troubleshooting. If something goes wrong it's nice to have an opportunity to limit the scope for cloud services only.
3. Fully functioning deliverables. If the automated deployment is used (e.g. BTP Setup Automator Tool) it is expected that the resulting application is ready to use (even if further configuration is needed).
4. Automated integration/E2E tests.

## Features

General features:
- OData Endpoints for both versions - [V2](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/odata#v2-support) and V4
- CSV files for [mock data](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/using-services#local-mocking)
- [Event emitting](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/messaging/#using-sap-event-mesh) on [data change](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/providing-services#registering-event-handlers)
- Enhancement possibilities (adding new services)
- In-memory [SQLite DB](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/databases#deploy-to-sqlite) is used (no DB instance is needed -> low cost, no dependencies)
- [SwaggerUI](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/openapi#swagger-ui)
- Emitting events compliant with the following Discover Center missions:
    - [S/4HANA Extension with Addon](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/protected/index.html#/missiondetail/3730/3769/)
    - [ECC Extension](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/protected/index.html#/missiondetail/3338/3384/)
    - [S/4HANA Extension](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-extension-ecc-business-process/blob/main/srv/service.js)???
- Hybrid testing with Event Mesh [test](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/hybrid-testing)
- Includes a script for destination creation

## Prerequisites

To deploy the mock server application it's necessary to have a Cloud Foundry runtime. For the moment the application is ready to be deployed in Cloud Foundry environment only. Kyma/K8s is temporarily out of scope.

## Quick deploy in Cloud Foundry Environment

1. Clone this repository to your SAP Business Application Studio workspace
2. Open cloned project folder
3. Right click on *mta.yaml* file and select **Build MTA Project**. The will generate an .MTAR file in mta_archives folder.
4. After build is done right click on mta_archives/Mockserver_1.0.0.mtar and select **Deploy MTA Archive**
    - You probably will be asked about Cloud Foundry login. Follow the instructions on the screen to enter you CF Endpoint and credentials. On the latest step you will choose your target CF Organization and CF Space.
5. \[OPTIONAL\] If you already have some Event Mesh instance you can bind it from terminal after the deployment is successfully done:
    - Open new terminal window with Ctrl+`
    - Enter the following command:
    <code>cf bs mock-srv BusinessPartnerValidation-ems && cf restart mock-srv</code>
    - NOTE: in the example above the name of Event Mesh service instance is BusinessPartnerValidation-ems. It can be different in your case!
6. \[OPTIONAL\] You can also create a destination to the newly deployed Mock Server Application. It's only relevant if you have a destination service instance created in your CF space.  Go to terminal and start the following command:
    <code>bash create-destination.sh bupa BusinessPartnerValidation-dest</code>
    - NOTE: in the command above the destination name is "bupa". You can change it as you need.
    - NOTE: in the command above the destination service instance is "BusinessPartnerValidation-dest". You can change it as you need.

## How to use

1. After the successful deployment you will get the following message:

    <code>Application "mock-srv" started and available at "..."</code>

2. Follow the given URL to get the CAP App Index Page. You can find *'/op-api-business-partner-srv'* link there. This URL can be used as OData V4 Endpoint. Use this URL in the corresponding destination for your mission.

3. If you need V2 Endpoint please add '/v2' to the endpoint URL to get something like that:

    <code>https://someDomain/odata/v2/op-api-business-partner-srv</code>

3. On the index page there is also a link to SwaggerUI: *Open API Preview*. Open it and go to the section *POST /A_BusinessPartner*. Click the button *Try it out*. Use the following JSON as a payload (replace the proposed one):

```
    {  
	"BusinessPartner": "555",  
	"BusinessPartnerName": "Max Mustermann",  
	"BusinessPartnerFullName": "Max Mustermann",  
	"FirstName": "Max",  
	"LastName": "Mustermann",  
	"BusinessPartnerIsBlocked": true,  
	"to_BusinessPartnerAddress": [{  
        "BusinessPartner": "555",  
		"AddressID": "1",  
		"StreetName": "Platz der Republik",  
		"HouseNumber": "1",  
		"PostalCode": "10557",  
		"CityName": "Berlin",  
		"Country": "DE"  
		}]  
    }
```    

4. Click *Execute*. You should get a response with the code 201. This means that the entry was created in the database and the corresponding event was triggered (if the Event Mesh instance is binded).

## Hybrid test

With the hybrid testing capabilities, you stay in your local development environment and avoid long turn-around times of cloud deployment and you can use Event Mesh instance from the cloud.

It's assumed that the Event Mesh service and its key is already created beforehand.

Before the test you should be logged in to the Cloud Foundry Environment. To do it use *Ctrl+Shift+P* and select *CF: Login To Cloud Foundry*. Follow the next instructions on the screen.

To bind the Event Mesh service use the following command in terminal:

<code>cds bind messaging -2 BusinessPartnerValidation-ems:emkey</code>

After that the file *.cdsrc-private.json* will be created/updated with the corresponding information.

To start the Mock Server in hybrid mode use the following command:

<code>cds watch --profile hybrid</code>

## Project Structure

It contains these folders and files, following our recommended project layout:

File or Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
`app/` | content for UI frontends goes here
`img/` | images for README.md
`srv/` | service models and CSV data
`package.json` | project metadata and configuration
`readme.md` | this getting started guide
`mta.yaml` | ...
`server.js` | ...


- Open a new terminal and run `cds watch` 
- (in VS Code simply choose _**Terminal** > Run Task > cds watch_)

## Changing Mock Data

If you want to deploy the Mock Server with other mock data you should change the corresponding CSV files in *srv/csv/* folder.

For example to create a new business partner add a new line to *OP_API_BUSINESS_PARTNER_SRV-A_BusinessPartner.csv* file. The content of the line should exactly correspond to the header line of the file. Here is an example how to add a new business partner with the ID, name and category filled only:

![New mock data line](img/new-mock-data-line.png)

To add additional field to the mock data do the following: 
- check the field name in the model file *srv/external/OP_API_BUSINESS_PARTNER_SRV.cds*:
  ![Field Name in Model](img/model-file-example.png)
- add the field name to the header and field value to the lines correspondingly:
  ![New field data](img/new-field.png)
- **[NOTE]:** you should adjust all the existing lines with the new field(s)!

## Adding own services

To add another service from SAP API Business Hub follow the instructions [here](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/using-services#from-api-hub).

Note: old models have incorrect connection between object nodes. In the generated CDS it could look that:

```
entity API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.A_BusinessPartner{    

   /**
   * Please add  an ON condition  
   */    
   Association to many API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.A_BusinessPartnerAddress{ }    

}
```

This shoud be changed to:

```
entity API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.A_BusinessPartner{    

   Composition of  many API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.A_BusinessPartnerAddress
    on to_BusinessPartnerAddress.BusinessPartner = BusinessPartner;

}
```

The difference between compositions and association read [here](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl#associations).
